# Time Complexity
'''
Normal Approach: The time complexity of this solution is O(n*sqrt(n)) because we loop from 2 to the square root of A and then from 2 to A.
Optimized Approach: The time complexity of this solution is O(n*log(log(n))) because we loop from 2 to the square root of A and then from 2 to A.
'''

# Space Complexity
'''
Normal Approach: The space complexity of this solution is O(1) because we use a constant amount of extra space.
Optimized Approach: The space complexity of this solution is O(n) because we use a list of size n+1.
'''

# Optimized Approach
'''
We can optimize the above approach by using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.
We will initialize a list of size n+1 with all elements set to True.
We will then loop from 2 to the square root of n and mark all multiples of i as False.
Finally, we will count the number of True elements in the list.
